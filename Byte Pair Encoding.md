> A way to break down words into common pieces by sticking together pairs that appear a lot

> Which letters tend to be together a lot?

Start with letters --> stick together pairs that appear a lot --> make word pieces

### Example: Banana
```mermaid
graph TD
	A[B - a - n - a - n - a] -->|*an* appears twice!| B[B - an - an - a]
	B -->|*ana* appears twice!| C[B - ana - na]
```
