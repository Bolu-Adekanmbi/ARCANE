> A way to measure how well the neural network performed

The loss function compares the models output (predicted) to the true value (ground truth) and produces a number call the loss
- Small Loss means the prediction was close to correct
- Big Loss means the prediction was way off

The goal in training: Make Loss as small as possible

There are numerous ways to define the loss function
