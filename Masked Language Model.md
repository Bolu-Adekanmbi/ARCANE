> Predict missing words anywhere in a sentence

It uses context from both before and after the missing token.

Fill in the blank based on full context

Mainly useful for non-generative tasks:
- Text classification
- Sentiment Analysis
- **Code Debugging** (context here is important) <- we need preceding and following code to figure out errors
