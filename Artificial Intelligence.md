There are many ways to divide and break down [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]]. 
One approach is based on "general ability" which leads to the following categories:
- [[Strong AI]]
- [[Weak AI]]

```mermaid
graph LR
	A[Artificial Intelligence] --> B[Strong AI ~ AGI]
	A --> C[Weak AI ~ Current AI]
```

Software it _deterministic_ but AI models are _probabilistic_
