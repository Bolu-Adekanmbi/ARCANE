Otherwise known as AGI, Strong AI refers to a theoretical version of [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] that is able to operate and perform tasks at a human-level (lower bound) with the ability to perform tasks that are dissimilar to prior training.

It is also often depicted that Strong AI has "self-extensibility", the ability to teach itself.
