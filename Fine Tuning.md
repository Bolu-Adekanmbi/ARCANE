> Fine-tuning teaches a "generalized" AI to do a specific task better

> [[Pretraining]] gives a model foundational knowledge, and then fine-tuning adjusts that knowledge to perform well within a specific domain

Fine Tuning adjusts model parameters to do a better job at a <u>specified</u> task

Fine tuning may also include making sure that the model is aligned to human values

Typically, fine tuning involves using a smaller, high-quality dataset relevant to the specific task/domain.
