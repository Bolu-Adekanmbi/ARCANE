Fine Tuning adjusts model parameters to do a better job at a <u>specified</u> task

Fine tuning may also include making sure that the model is aligned to human values 
- This is rather interesting #TODO %%<-- I want to explore this more deeply %%

Typically, fine tuning involves using a smaller, high-quality dataset relevant to the specific task/domain.

Due to the scale of [[Foundation Model|foundation models]], fine-tuning models natively can be memory-intensive. Therefore, there are techniques for doing so with less memory. #TODO
